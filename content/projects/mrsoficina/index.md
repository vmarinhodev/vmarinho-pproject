      title: Responsive Web Design art direction
      subtitle: A website is, first and foremost, a means of communication.
      content: Any time we alter our images visually to fit a different context, we’re “art directing.” A resolution-adaptable image will look identical everywhere — it only resizes. An art-directed image changes in visually noticeable ways. Most of the time, that means cropping, either to fit a new layout or to keep the most important bits of the image visible when it’s viewed at small physical sizes.

  ProjectBodyHighlight:
    primary:
      title: Art direction in responsive images with picture
      subtitle: deliver an appropriate image to every user depending on a variety of conditions like screen size, viewport size, screen resolution, and more.
      content: To change images based on device characteristics, also known as art direction, use the picture element. The picture element defines a declarative solution for providing multiple versions of an image based on different characteristics, like device size, device resolution, orientation, and more.
